# Privacy Policy

The protection of your personal data is very important to us, and we understand our responsibilities to handle your personal data with care, to keep it secure and to comply with legal requirements.



<br>

## 1. Privacy policy contents
This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect your personal data and the choices available to you regarding collection, process, access, and how to update, correct and delete your personal data. Additional information on our personal data practices may be provided in product settings, contractual terms, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection

## 2. What data do we collect?


### 2.1 User Activity Data
While a user's device is tunneled through VPN, we collect some information about how they're using it. We record what protocol VPN used to connect, how long the device was connected, how many bytes were transferred during the session, and what city, country, and ISP the connection came from. For some domains (but very few, and only popular ones) or server IP addresses (e.g., known malware servers) that are visited, we also record how many bytes were transferred to it. (But never full URLs or anything more sensitive. And only domains of general interest, not all domains.)

Geographical location and ISP info are derived from user IP addresses, which are then immediately discarded.

We consider user activity data the most sensitive category of data. We never, ever share this data with third parties. We keep user activity data for at most 60 days, and then we aggregate it and delete it. Backups of that data are kept for a reasonable amount of time.

### 2.2 Aggregated Data
Data is “aggregated” by taking a lot of sensitive user activity data and combining it together to form coarse statistical data that is no longer specific to a user. After aggregation, the user activity data is deleted.

Aggregated data is much less sensitive than activity data, but we still treat it as potentially sensitive and do not share it in this form.

### 2.3 Shareable Aggregated Data
When sharing aggregated data with third parties, we make sure that the data could not be combined with other sources to reveal user identities. For example, we do not share data for countries that only have a few VPN users in a day. We make sure that the data is anonymized.

We also never share domain-related information with third parties.

<br>

## 3. Children’s privacy

If you become aware or have any reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has shared any information with us, please contact us and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.

## 6. How long do we keep your personal data?
We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary. In some circumstances we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.

In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings. Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or stored in a way which means it will no longer be used by the business.
